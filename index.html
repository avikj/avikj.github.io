				<h3>Terminal over Facebook Messenger</h3>
				<p>fbash allows users to run shell commands on their computer or a server remotely through Facebook Messenger. It takes advantage of Messenger's various features, including sending attachments, joining group chats, and advanced syntax highlighting to provide an experience better than that of a traditional SSH client.</p>
				<br>
				<p>It is published as an NPM module to be installed globally. After installation, it can be started through the command-line and runs as a background process.</p>

				<p class="award">Over 1.9k installs through NPM</p>

				<h3>Crowd-sourcing Health Emergency Response</h3>
				<p>SwiftAssist is an application that revolutionizes health emergency response using crowdsourcing. It allows users with health issues to instantly notify other nearby users when they need assistance. For example, if a user is having an allergic reaction and they do not have their epinephrine injector (EpiPen), they can press a button on their Pebble smartwatch or smartwatch to notify nearby users who can help them. These users recieve an alert on their phones and can view directions to the location of the emergency, along with what type of emergency it is.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I built the Pebble smartwatch app using the Pebble.js SDK as well as the Android app using Java.</p>

				<h3>An Educational Twist on FlappyBird</h3>
				<p>FlappyNerd is a Java-based, FlappyBird-like game that uses its addictive nature to help users study in a fun way. Unlike FlappyBird, each pipe has 2 gaps, and the user must maneuver the bird through the gap that has the matching answer to the term displayed below. It uses Quizlet as a source for the game data and allows users to search sets or explicitly provide a URL.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I wrote the code for the gravitational physics, collision detection, and graphics.</p>

				<h3>MV JSA's Member Portal and Moderated Blogging Platform</h3>
				<p>Monta Vista High School's students tend to be very liberal, and because of this, campus newspapers tend to be very politically one-sided. MV Junior State of America, our schools premiere politics club, wanted to provide a platform on which political discussion could occur openly, where any student could express their views. To this end, I created a blogging platform for members of MV JSA. It allows members to express their opinions through richly formatted blog posts, which are reviewed by admins prior to publication.</p>
				<br>
				<p>MV JSA expects this platform to be used widely among members and its content to be read by hundreds of Monta Vista students.</p>
