				<h2>fbash</h2>
				<h3>Terminal over Facebook Messenger</h3>
				<p>fbash allows users to run shell commands on their computer or a server remotely through Facebook Messenger. It takes advantage of Messenger's various features, including sending attachments, joining group chats, and advanced syntax highlighting to provide an experience better than that of a traditional SSH client.</p>
				<br>
				<p>It is published as an NPM module to be installed globally. After installation, it can be started through the command-line and runs as a background process.</p>

				<h2>SwiftAssist</h2>
				<h3>Crowd-sourcing Health Emergency Response</h3>
				<p>SwiftAssist is an application that revolutionizes health emergency response using crowdsourcing. It allows users with health issues to instantly notify other nearby users when they need assistance. For example, if a user is having an allergic reaction and they do not have their epinephrine injector (EpiPen), they can press a button on their Pebble smartwatch or smartwatch to notify nearby users who can help them. These users recieve an alert on their phones and can view directions to the location of the emergency, along with what type of emergency it is.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I built the Pebble smartwatch app using the Pebble.js SDK as well as the Android app using Java.</p>
